# Email Notification & PDF Ticket Generation Feature Implementation

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of email notification and PDF ticket generation features for the Onvent booking system. When a user books a ticket, they will now receive:
1. An email confirmation with the ticket details
2. A PDF attachment of their ticket

## Features Implemented

### 1. Email Notification Service
- **EmailService.java**: A service class that handles sending emails using Spring Mail
- Configured to work with Gmail SMTP (can be changed in application.properties)
- Sends HTML formatted emails with ticket details
- Attaches the generated PDF ticket to the email

### 2. PDF Ticket Generation Service
- **PdfTicketService.java**: A service class that generates PDF tickets using the iText library
- Creates a formatted ticket with:
  - Event details (name, date, location)
  - Attendee information
  - Booking information
  - Ticket ID and pricing

### 3. Integration with Booking Workflow
- Modified **TicketService.java** to:
  - Generate a PDF ticket after successful booking
  - Send an email confirmation with the PDF attached
  - Include all relevant booking details in the email

## Technical Details

### Dependencies Added
1. Spring Boot Starter Mail (for email functionality)
2. iText 7 Core (for PDF generation)

### Configuration
Email settings are configured in `application.properties`:
```properties
spring.mail.host=smtp.gmail.com
spring.mail.port=587
spring.mail.username=your_email@gmail.com
spring.mail.password=your_app_password
spring.mail.properties.mail.smtp.auth=true
spring.mail.properties.mail.smtp.starttls.enable=true
```

### Key Classes

#### EmailService.java
- Uses JavaMailSender to send emails
- Supports HTML content and file attachments
- Handles email sending exceptions

#### PdfTicketService.java
- Generates professional-looking PDF tickets
- Uses iText 7 library for PDF creation
- Includes event and attendee information

#### TicketService.java (modified)
- Integrated email and PDF generation into the booking flow
- Sends confirmation email after successful ticket creation

## How It Works
1. When a user books a ticket through the `/tickets/book` endpoint:
   - The ticket is created in the database
   - A PDF ticket is generated using PdfTicketService
   - An email confirmation is sent using EmailService with the PDF attached

## Testing
The feature has been tested by:
1. Compiling the entire project successfully
2. Running the Spring Boot application without errors
3. Verifying that all services are properly autowired

## Future Enhancements
1. Add QR code generation for tickets
2. Customize email templates
3. Add support for multiple attachments
4. Implement email queuing for better performance
5. Add email tracking and delivery confirmation
